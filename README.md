# BLACK BEAR TEA WEBSITE
I made a landing page for my tea company website as a school project.
The website has a simple navbar, an about us section and a simple e-shop. Sadly the eshop isn't functional yet because I don't know how to program it.

HTML and CSS was made in VSC, logo was made in Inkscape and photos shoot on Canon 700D and edited in Adobe Photoshop.

I added as well my Adobe XD design of the website.
Use whatever you like but dont forget to mention me :D <3
